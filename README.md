# SIMD_YUV_Convertion

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LC-John/SIMD_YUV_Convertion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LC-John/SIMD_YUV_Convertion)

This is a project of Computer Organization and Achitecture, PKU. LAB4.1 is included.

There may be some bugs, because my yuv vedios are red-biased.
Maybe using another yuv2rgb formula will fix the problem.

## Notice

Last but the most important thing is that you can reference them, but **PLEASE DO NOT COPY**! If you copy this project and get caught, no one can help you, and you deserve nothing but a zero score. 

Heads up! I've inserted something into my code. It will somehow show the identification information of the true author, which is me. So anaing, **DO NOT COPY**.

Good luck and have fun. :)
