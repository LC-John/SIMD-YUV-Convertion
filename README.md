# SIMD_YUV_Convertion

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LC-John/SIMD_YUV_Convertion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LC-John/SIMD_YUV_Convertion)

This is a project of Computer Organization and Achitecture, PKU. LAB4.1 is included.

There may be some bugs, because my yuv vedios are red-biased.
Maybe using another yuv2rgb formula will fix the problem.

Last but the most important thing is that PLEASE DO NOT COPY!

# DO NOT COPY

Last but the most important thing is that you can reference them, but PLEASE DO NOT COPY! If you copy this project and get caught, no one can help you, and you deserve nothing but a zero score.

Good luck and have fun. :)
